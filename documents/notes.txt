A refrigerator is an essential household appliance used to preserve food and beverages by keeping them at a low temperature. It works by removing heat from the inside compartment, which slows down the growth of bacteria and helps food stay fresh for a longer time. Refrigerators are commonly used to store vegetables, fruits, dairy products, cooked meals, and cold drinks. Modern refrigerators come with features such as adjustable shelves, temperature control, frost-free technology, and energy-efficient operation. Because of their convenience and importance in daily life, refrigerators play a vital role in maintaining food quality and reducing wastage.
